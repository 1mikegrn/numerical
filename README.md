# Numerical

A python library for executing numerical methods on python objects

## Purpose

This is really just a side project for trying to implement standard numerical method operations on python objects. I'm curious as to how writing C extensions to interact with python's data types vit the C/Python API will compare in terms of execution speed against implementations like scipy/sklearn which partially use cython as a means of codifying numerical computation and further build upon numpy's Data Object Model for standardizing data abstractions. My goal is to use only Native Python and the C/Python API as a means for computation.
